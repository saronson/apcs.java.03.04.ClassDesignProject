# Class Design Project

Pick some topic that holds interest for you.
Design a class that represents this topic.
The class should have:


- instance variables (at least two)
- constants (at least one)
- constructors (at least two, one of which is a default constructor)
- accessor and mutator methods (gets and sets for each instance variable)
- ```public String toString()``` method
- ```public boolean equals(Object obj)``` method 
- change Test class to make some objects from your class and do something interesting with them

If you want to get input from a user in your test program,  here is code to do that:
  ```java.util.Scanner scan = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);```
  ```scan.next()``` will have user enter a String
  ```scan.nextInt()``` will have user enter an integer
  ```scan.nextDouble()``` will have user enter a double
